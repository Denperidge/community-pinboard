# Community Pinboard
[Repository](https://github.com/Denperidge/community-pinboard) - [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/denperidge/community-pinboard) - [Development/bug tracker](https://github.com/Denperidge/community-pinboard/issues)

A public event pinboard webapp for your local community, meant to be even lighter on the client devices than on the server!

It says 'Custom pinboard title!' on the top, with 3 pins on the board and one item previewed on the right. The 3 pins are: 'Gloss concert, 4/30/2024, Brussels, Cat' and 'Queer punk DIY day!, 4/27/2024, Ash's place, Ash' and 'going out, 4/30/2024, near Rue Royale 236, Bruxelles, Quinn'. On the right is the 'Pin view' panel, with the gloss concert pin background image displayed fully, the title + location shown, and the time/day entry is now expanded to include both date and time" />

## How-to
### Run using Docker Compose
Recommended for: **production**

*Pre-requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#scenario-two-install-the-compose-plugin)*

1. Create `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:
    ```yml
    # docker-compose.yml
    services:
      community-pinboard:
        # Pull the Docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/denperidge/community-pinboard
        image: denperidge/community-pinboard:latest
        volumes:
          - ./data/:/app/data  # Mount data directory in ./data
        ports:
          - 3000:3000  # Expose port 3000
        # Optionally, load environment variables from .env
        env_file:
          - path: .env
            required: false
    ```
2. Optionally, create a `.env` file to [configure environment variables](#environment-variables)
3. Run `docker compose up --detach`

You can now access the server from `localhost:3000`, and any pins & uploads in the `data/` directory


### Run using Docker
Recommended for: **production**

*Pre-requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)*

```bash
# Pull & run image
docker run -p 3000:3000 denperidge/community-pinboard:latest
```
You can now access the server from `localhost:3000`

*Note: this example does not automatically bind ./data to /app/data*


### Install and run using Node.js
Recommended for: **development**

*Pre-requirements: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)*

### Configuration/environment variables
For customisation, please set the environment variables in your shell, docker-compose or a .env file in the root directory (the same directory this file, [README.md](README.md) is in)

For all configuration options, please refer to [Reference: Environment variables](#environment-variables).

## Explanation
### Base design decisions
This application was built to replace fragmented organising through multiple Facebook organisations, Discord servers and Whatsapp pinned messages. This means that by design, the systems built here have to go against this. Below are some of what I have found to be failings of the above tactics
- **Non-account-based:** Making new accounts feels like second nature to a good portion of the internets users, but it is a *hassle*, especially for those with less technological skills. *Whatsapp* circumvented this by using phone numbers, but it still requires an install, and it's still a product of Meta (a company known for an intrinsic disrespect to the privacy of its users). If authentication becomes an element, something simple should be used during pin creation/editing, but a full login and registering system is out of scope.
- **Lightweight:** Some apps like *Messenger*, *Facebook* and *Discord* or even some websites have forgotten that having your mobile phone isn't sending 500 requests and 20 animations simultaneously may slow down its performance. This website should be as streamlined as possible, and requires as little javascript as possible. All the heavy lifting - if any - should be done on the server side.
- **Easy setup & administration:** While you might need some technological know-how to get it Community Pinboard up and running at first, the server side is kept intentionally compact. The dependencies and devDepedencies in [package.json](package.json) should be split to ensure that the production version does not get overbloated. The decision to use a simple file-based hierarchy is also in support of this, so that file-based management can be done in case of mistakes or problems.
- **Cross-platform:** Everything has an app, but not everything should be. People barely get around to installing a calendar/scheduling app for people they live or work with, let alone this! A simple, clearview website.
- **Accessible:** Care should be put into the accessibility of the project. Mandatory image descriptions is a measure that - even though it might have to get a toggle down the line - an attempt at a step to making user-generated content more accessible, or at least thought about. Further care should also be put in providing as well-polished accessibility from the get-go.

### Timezone handling
#### Use cases
Datetime and timezones are relevant in the following parts of the application

Legend:
- üíö: UTC Value
- üïí: Adjusted for timezone
- üè†: Adjusted for locale

| Functionality | Should be displayed/passed as | Relevant files |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| View Pin date & datetime strings | üïíüè† | [Pin (pre)views](views/_pin.pug), [index page](views/index.pug) |
| Fill in edit form pin existing value | üïí | [form page](views/_form.pug), [form back-end](app/form.ts), [edit page](views/edit.pug), [edit routes](app/routes.edit.ts) |
| Read & write `data/pins/*.json` | üíö | [Pin class](app/Pin.ts), [ICS feeds](app/routes.get.ts) |
| Add-To-Calendar-Button | üíö? TODO | [Pin class](app/Pin.ts), [Pin (pre)views](views/_pin.pug) |
| ICS feeds | TODO: double check | [Pin class](app/Pin.ts), [ICS Feed get routes](app/routes.get.ts) |

#### Pins
Every datetime stored in `data/pins/` is in **UTC**. See the [PinUTCDatetime class in app/Pin.ts](app/Pin.ts).
This was originally handled by saving and parsing from JavaScript's JSON.stringify, but [Javascript Date handling](#javascript-date) got the better of me.

This method of storing ensures a base certainty: the Pin class and JSON only contain **UTC**.


#### HTML Forms
For native `HTML` date(time) input, you have...
- `date` (which doesn't include time)
- `datetime-local` (which doesn't include timezone information)

No timezone-based `datetime` is available.
To ensure compatibility with more devices and lower client-side footprint, the native `datetime-local` input is used
(as opposed to a JS library solution).

- This returns **no timezone** information. The returned value is in the format of `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`
- This means that the input values will be from the **users timezone point of view**


#### Javascript Date()
- `JavaScript Date()` also includes time
- Stored in **UTC**, specifically ms since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC ([see w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_dates.asp))
- I haven't have it gotten to consistently parse UTC strings *with* timezone information. This might be a goof on my end, though.
- `new Date().getTimezoneOffset()` is based on [TZ environment variable](#environment-variables).
- JavaScripts UTC constructor can deal with too many hours being provided. `new Date(Date.UTC(2024, 1, 1, 25, 0)).toISOString()` returns `"2024-02-02T01:00:00.000Z"`

#### Node.js
- `process.env.tz` Returns a `Area/City` format. See the [Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/v20.12.1/api/cli.html#tz) for more information

#### add-to-calendar-button
- Has `{start,end}Date` & `{start,end}Time`, both *seemingly* assuming the values to be **UTC**
- [timeZone config](https://add-to-calendar-button.com/configuration#event-parameters) 
  - This uses a library of the same developer for valid inputs for timeZone. See a few of the [available notations in the source code here](https://github.com/add2cal/timezones-ical-library/blob/308756344dc314a1499e298b9e99ad0377244c3e/src/zonesdb.js)
  - My best results were with using `Area/City`. This will be set in the `WEBSITE_TIMEZONE` [environment variable](#environment-variables)
