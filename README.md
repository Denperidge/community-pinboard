# Community Pinboard
A public event pinboard webapp for your local community, meant to be even lighter on the client devices than on the server!

## How-to
### Run using Docker Compose
Recommended for: **production**

*Pre-requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#scenario-two-install-the-compose-plugin)*

1. Create `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:
    ```yml
    # docker-compose.yml
    services:
      community-pinboard:
        # Pull the Docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/denperidge/community-pinboard
        image: denperidge/community-pinboard:latest
        volumes:
          - ./data/:/app/data  # Mount data directory in ./data
        ports:
          - 3000:3000  # Expose port 3000
        # Optionally, load environment variables from .env
        env_file:
          - path: .env
            required: false
    ```
2. Optionally, create a `.env` file to [configure environment variables](#environment-variables)
3. Run `docker compose up --detach`

You can now access the server from `localhost:3000`, and any pins & uploads in the `data/` directory


### Run using Docker
Recommended for: **production**

*Pre-requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)*

```bash
# Pull & run image
docker run -p 3000:3000 denperidge/community-pinboard:latest
```
You can now access the server from `localhost:3000`

*Note: this example does not automatically bind ./data to /app/data*


### Install and run using Node.js
Recommended for: **development**

*Pre-requirements: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)*

```bash
# Clone the repository, navigate to it and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/Denperidge/community-pinboard.git
cd community-pinboard
yarn install

yarn build  # Build to dist/
yarn prod  # Run from dist/
```
You can now access the server from `localhost:3000`, and any pins & uploads in the `data/` directory

(Alternative use `yarn dev` for live-reload development, or check the other scripts defined in [package.json](package.json))


### Build and run using Docker
Recommended for: **development**

*Pre-requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)*

```bash
# Clone the repository & navigate to it
git clone https://github.com/Denperidge/community-pinboard.git
cd community-pinboard
docker build -t community-pinboard .

# Run image
docker run -p 3000:3000 community-pinboard
```
You can now access the server from `localhost:3000`

*Note: this example does not automatically bind ./data to /app/data*


### Build and run using Docker-Compose
Recommended for: **development**

```bash
# Clone the repository & navigate to it
git clone https://github.com/Denperidge/community-pinboard.git
cd community-pinboard

# Build and run image
docker compose up --build
```
You can now access the server from `localhost:3000`, and any pins & uploads in the `data/` directory


### Configuration/environment variables
For customisation, please set the environment variables in your shell, docker-compose or a .env file in the root directory (the same directory this file, [README.md](README.md) is in)

For all configuration options, please refer to [Reference: Environment variables](#environment-variables).
